  script/generate acts_as_secure_url [options] Model Controller
  
Generates a basic model and controller for your secure class, plus
a migration file and a named route for secure URLs.

Suported options:

  --skip-migration          Skips the migration file, be sure to
                            include an access_key and salt in your
                            database table
                            
  --persist-public-key      Adds a public_key column to the database
                            migration. This makes setup easy, but
                            degrades security; if your database is 
                            ever compromised, it can be used to 
                            recreate public URLs.
